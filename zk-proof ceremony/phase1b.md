pretty straightforward,

cd snark-setup-operator
```

```
screen -S nimiq
```

```
cargo run --release --bin contribute -- --coordinator-url "https://zkp-ceremony.nimiq.com/"
```



- enter seed phrase when asked 

- enter random letters when asked for "entropy"


-  use ctrl A + D to exit 



- you can leave your machine screen on,this would take a very long time and consume a lot of computational power, if you are using vps however you are free to put off your pc
